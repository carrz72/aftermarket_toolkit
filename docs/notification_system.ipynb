    "The notification system is a core component of the Aftermarket Toolkit application that provides real-time updates to users about important events such as messages, forum replies, friend requests, and listing comments. The system includes both in-app notifications and email notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notification system is designed to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time**: Notifications appear immediately when events occur\n",
    "- **Persistent**: Notifications are stored in the database\n",
    "- **Cross-page**: Notifications are accessible from anywhere in the application\n",
    "- **Multi-channel**: Notifications can be delivered in-app and via email"

    "\n",
    "1. **Database Layer**: Stores notifications in the `notifications` table\n",
    "2. **Backend PHP Functions**: Handles creating, retrieving, and managing notifications\n",
    "3. **Email Notification System**: Sends email notifications when configured\n",
    "4. **Frontend JavaScript**: Displays notifications in the UI and handles user interactions\n",
    "5. **CSS Styling**: Provides visual styling for the notification components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component Interaction Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Trigger**: User action or system event (e.g., forum reply, message)\n",
    "2. **Notification Creation**: Backend creates a notification record\n",
    "3. **Email Notification**: Optional email is sent if user has enabled it\n",
    "4. **Notification Fetching**: Frontend regularly polls for new notifications\n",
    "5. **UI Update**: Notification badge and dropdown are updated\n",
    "6. **User Interaction**: User can view, mark as read, or delete notifications"

    "```php\n",
    "function sendNotification($conn, $userId, $type, $senderId = null, $relatedId = null, $content = '', $link = null) {\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Retrieving Notifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Notifications are retrieved using the `getUserNotifications()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```php\n",
    "function getUserNotifications($conn, $userId, $limit = 10, $unreadOnly = false) {\n",
    "    // Query database for notifications\n",

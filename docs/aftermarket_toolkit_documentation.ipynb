    "## Frontend Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aftermarket Toolkit frontend integrates with the backend through a combination of traditional PHP rendering, AJAX requests, and modern JavaScript functionality. This approach allows for a dynamic user experience while maintaining compatibility with a variety of browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure\n",
    "- **CSS3**: Responsive styling with flexbox and grid layouts\n",
    "- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity and AJAX requests\n",
    "- **jQuery**: Used for some DOM manipulation and AJAX simplification\n",
    "- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for visual elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Server-Side Rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "For initial page loads and non-interactive content, the application uses traditional server-side rendering with PHP:\n",
    "\n",
    "```php\n",
    "<!-- Example of server-side rendered content from forum.php -->\n",
    "<?php foreach ($threads as $thread): ?>\n",
    "<div class=\"forumcard\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"forum-profile\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"<?= getProfilePicturePath($thread['profile_pic']) ?>\" alt=\"<?= htmlspecialchars($thread['username']) ?>\" class=\"profile-pic\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"pro-details\">\n",
    "      <h3><?= htmlspecialchars($thread['username']) ?></h3>\n",
    "      <p>Posted on: <?= formatDate($thread['created_at']) ?></p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  <div class=\"forum-content\">\n",
    "    <h2 class=\"card-title\"><?= htmlspecialchars($thread['title']) ?></h2>\n",
    "    <p><?= nl2br(htmlspecialchars(substr($thread['body'], 0, 200))) ?><?= strlen($thread['body']) > 200 ? '...' : '' ?></p>\n",
    "    <a href=\"forum.php?thread=<?= $thread['id'] ?>\" class=\"btn-post\">Read More</a>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<?php endforeach; ?>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. AJAX for Dynamic Content\n",
    "\n",
    "For dynamic content updates without page refreshes, the application uses AJAX requests to PHP endpoints that return JSON data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example from notifications.js for fetching notifications\n",
    "function fetchNotifications() {\n",
    "    const baseUrl = window.location.pathname.includes('/public/') ? '..' : '/aftermarket_toolkit';\n",
    "    \n",
    "    fetch(`${baseUrl}/public/api/notifications.php`)\n",
    "        .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "        .then(data => {\n",
    "            if (data.success) {\n",
    "                updateNotificationBadge(data.unreadCount);\n",
    "                updateNotificationDropdown(data.notifications);\n",
    "            }\n",

    "        .catch(error => {\n",
    "            console.error('Error fetching notifications:', error);\n",
    "        });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Corresponding PHP endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```php\n",
    "// Example from notifications.php API endpoint\n",
    "header('Content-Type: application/json');\n",
    "\n",
    "if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {\n",

    "$userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];\n",
    "$notifications = getUserNotifications($conn, $userId, 10, false);\n",
    "$unreadCount = countUnreadNotifications($conn, $userId)['total'];\n",
    "\n",
    "echo json_encode([\n",
    "    'success' => true,\n",
    "    'notifications' => $notifications,\n",
    "    'unreadCount' => $unreadCount\n",
    "]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Real-Time Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "For features like chat, the application uses polling to create a semi-real-time experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example from chat.js for refreshing chat messages\n",
    "function startChatRefresh() {\n",
    "    if (chatMessages && document.getElementById('active-chat')) {\n",
    "        const recipientId = document.getElementById('recipient_id').value;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        chatRefreshInterval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "            // Only refresh if the user hasn't scrolled up to read history\n",
    "            if (chatMessages.scrollHeight - chatMessages.scrollTop <= chatMessages.clientHeight + 100) {\n",
    "                refreshChatMessages(recipientId);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }, 10000); // Poll every 10 seconds\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms are handled with a combination of JavaScript validation and server-side processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example of frontend form validation\n",
    "document.getElementById('message-form').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {\n",
    "    e.preventDefault();\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "    if (message.length === 0) {\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Send message using AJAX\n",
    "    fetch('../api/chat/enhanced_chat_message_handler.php', {\n",
    "        method: 'POST',\n",
    "        headers: {\n",

    "        body: `recipient_id=${recipientId}&message=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "    .then(data => {\n",
    "        if (data.success) {\n",
    "            // Update UI with new message\n",
    "            messageInput.value = '';\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            alert(data.message || 'Error sending message. Please try again.');\n",
    "        }\n",

    "    });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notification System Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The notification system is a prime example of frontend-backend integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backend Storage**: Notifications are stored in the database\n",
    "2. **API Endpoints**: JSON endpoints provide notification data\n",
    "3. **JavaScript Polling**: Frontend regularly checks for new notifications\n",
    "4. **DOM Updates**: UI is updated dynamically with new notifications\n",
    "5. **Read Status Tracking**: Backend tracks which notifications have been read\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example of notification badge update\n",
    "function updateNotificationBadge(count) {\n",
    "    const badge = document.getElementById('notification-badge');\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if (!badge) return;\n",

    "    if (count > 0) {\n",
    "        badge.style.display = 'inline-flex';\n",
    "        badge.textContent = count;\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        badge.style.display = 'none';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The application uses a custom CSS framework with responsive design principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes\n",
    "- **Flex Layouts**: Used for complex UI components\n",
    "- **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming\n",

    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* Example of CSS variables for theming */\n",
    ":root {\n",
    "  --primary-color: #189dc5;\n",

    "### Navigation and State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The application maintains state through a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PHP Sessions**: For user authentication and server-side state\n",
    "- **URL Parameters**: For page navigation and view switching\n",
    "- **Local Storage**: For persistent client-side preferences\n",
